On the other hand, if abnormalities are suspected in the sewage inflow, a pack test is also used to quickly measure the water quality.  \nThese pack tests are a fairly popular and inexpensive method. Tokyo's tap water is of such high quality that it can be used as drinking water. In order to keep high quality of the water, great care is taken to control the quality of the water. For example, Gas chromatography is used for detection and measurement of 2-MIB (2-Methylisoborneol), which causes moldy odors of water. \nWater quality investigations at sewage treatment plants are performed chemically on the sewage inflow after the sewage has been treated through a tank containing activated sludge.  \nThose in the treatment process and the treated water are measured in real time using sensors and other instruments, and the condition of the activated sludge is adjusted by changing the operating conditions in response to changes in the condition of sludge. \nHowever, it takes 0.5 to 1 day to adjust the condition of the activated sludge and to improve the conditions of the compounds after detecting abnormalities in the compounds in the wastewater.

However, both P and N are removed by the AO method. However, the removal of P and N are opposite functions. Therefore, if one of them becomes too strong, the removal of the other becomes insufficient. Under normal conditions, the rate of change is slow, but precipitation significantly changes the situation. Precipitation causes three to five times as much sewage to flow into the sewage treatment plant at once. When this happen, the condition of the activated sludge tank changes greatly due to changes in the balance of the sewage components.  There are many problems caused by the condition of activated sludge tanks in particular. \nOne major problem is the growth of malignant bacteria, such as actinomycetes.  Actinomycetes surround the bacteria with mycolic acid, which prevents the bubbles from popping and causes bubbles to increase on the surface of the water. Since the acid is a substance that cannot be biologically treated, it remains floating on the surface of the water together with the activated sludge, which is unfavorable for solid-liquid separation in the sedimentation basin. In addition, suppressing the amount of air supply to prevent foaming causes problems such as not being able to supply the oxygen necessary for treatment, which worsens the quality of treated water, and the scum that remains on the surface of the water causes flies and odors to be generated.  \n                        \n                          ")]),e._v(" "),o("p",{staticClass:"p_indent"},[e._v("  \n                            In order to prevent these problems, there was a need to determine the amount of actinomycetes and mycolic acid in the activated sludge and to measure the balance between them and various bacteria.  \nThey also pointed out that the kit may also be used as household tap water quality checking device.  \n                            \n                          ")])])],1),e._v(" "),o("v-row",{staticClass:"row_max-box",attrs:{cols:"12",sm:"12",xs:"12",md:"12",lg:"7",xl:"7"}},[o("v-col",[o("h3",[e._v("5.
