On the other hand, if abnormalities are suspected in the sewage inflow, a pack test is also used to quickly measure the water quality.  \nThese pack tests are a fairly popular and inexpensive method. Tokyo's tap water is of such high quality that it can be used as drinking water. In order to keep high quality of the water, great care is taken to control the quality of the water. For example, Gas chromatography is used for detection and measurement of 2-MIB (2-Methylisoborneol), which causes moldy odors of water. \nWater quality investigations at sewage treatment plants are performed chemically on the sewage inflow after the sewage has been treated through a tank containing activated sludge.  \nThose in the treatment process and the treated water are measured in real time using sensors and other instruments, and the condition of the activated sludge is adjusted by changing the operating conditions in response to changes in the condition of sludge. \nHowever, it takes 0.5 to 1 day to adjust the condition of the activated sludge and to improve the conditions of the compounds after detecting abnormalities in the compounds in the wastewater.
