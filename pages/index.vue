                  Once upon a time, there was a strange battle between two forces. 
                  One force was limonene scented zombies, and the other was Sabinene scented samurais. 
                  Limonene and Sabinene are aroma compounds which are often found in perfume and essential oils.
                  Each force released AHL, which made members of the opponent their companion. 
                  For example, if samurai members absorb a large amount of AHL released by the zombie force, the samurai members became members of the zombie force. 
                  The same happed vice versa. 
                  This story about an odd and strange struggle between two such forces ...

                We love easy-to-modulate cell-free system. However, during the initial phase of our iGEM project, we realized that Synbio and cell-free system is unrecognized from general public through our Human practice activities.  
                Thus, we selected the theme which is not only interesting as a story but also biologically important. Here was beginning of the story for information processing where mathematical modeling and wet experiment interacted each other through Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) cycle. 
                This battle story also expanded into war in the mirror which can be broken by racemase.  
                Our success in monoterpene productions for Zombie and Samurai also gave us an entry point for creation of our business model which was pivoted by interviews to experts.  
                Our experience in Synbio modeling was implanted in a smartphone application which we utilized when we had a chance to educate high school students.  
                By using our user-friendly application, they could understand a behavior of toggle switch circuit, which was one of the first successes in Synbio and important to understand cell-fate decision in developmental biology and regenerative medicine.

                    Rapid protein degradation is required to achieve working ZOMBIE vs SRAMURAI gene circuit in a cell-free system.
                     Therefore, we constructed plux/tet-GFPssrA ( <a class="link_style"  href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3580003">BBa_K3580003</a> ) by improving plux/tet-GFP ( <a class="link_style"  href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K934025">BBa_K934025</a> ) and test the effect of degradation tag in quorum sensing system.
                      We compared the fluorescence value of the GFP and tagged GFP both in vivo and in vitro. As a result, the value of tagged GFP was lower than that of normal GFP in both vivo and vitro, indication that degradation of GFP accelerated by the ssrA tag.

            One of our projects is synthesizing monoterpenes (limonene and sabinene) with cell free system, which has two strong points in bioproduction. Monoterpenes are useful for fragrance, fuel, and pesticides.
            In contrast with monoterpene synthesis using engineered microorganisms, cell-free synthesis can avoid the restriction caused by using living cells which is suffered from toxicity of monoterpenes. 
            The second strong point of the cell-free systems is its modularity of reaction solution. 
            When you make <i>E.coli</i> synthesizing monoterpenes, you have to introduce all kinds of gene required to synthesize monoterpenes into one cell. 
            In contrast, cell-free reaction allow mixing of multiple cell extract in any ratio and many combinations.. You can see our success here. (Go to Monoterpenes page) We think these strong points can achieve the engineering spirit of iGEM.

                To construct a system in which the scent automatically change over time, we have developed a multi-target IFFL, an extension of the incoherent feed forward loop (IFFL).
                The IFFL is a kind of basic gene circuit in which concentration of gene Z change like a pulse over time. In Multi IFFL, we planned to control the expression timing of multiple genes Z with the same gene X and gene Y. 
                We have extensively explored the model parameters to see if this system can actually create a time difference in the expression of the two genes. By balancing the shape of the two pulses and the time difference between the two peaks, we were able to create two pulses with a time lag in the model.

                In the zombie vs. Samurai storyline, we envisioned a scenario in which one side deprives their opponent of the food they need. That is to say, one side consumes D-amino acid and the other consumes L-amino acid derived food, and both sides converts their opponent’s amino acid to make them edible only for themselves. 
                We especially focused on alanine racemase (AR), known as an attractive target for the antibacterial drug development. We confirmed the conversion by using cell-free protein  synthesis dependent on D-alanine and racemase.

                When we started our project, we wanted to make sure that it was something that would be understood by society.  In our survey, we found that cell-free protein synthesis and synthetic biology have come to be linked in recent years.  We thought that we could tell biotechnology properly because a project in a cell-free system wouldn't be linked to bioethics. 
                We conducted further research on this project, which is very attractive to iGEMers.  Then, we decided to summarize our findings and present them. 
                We did lectures to a total of 272 people and conducted questionnaires before and after the lecture on the cognition of synthetic biology and cell-free system. 
                After the lecture, those with vague concerns got to have clear opinions compared to before. (Go to HumanPractice)
                Next, based on the evaluations we received from general public, we started basic experiments related to the project.  This year, due to the strong influence of COVID-19, we decided to focus on cell-free projects. 
                The relevance and scientific value of the project were established through expert opinions and discussions at the Spring Japan Meetup. 
                In addition, the project was designed with the utmost consideration for safety under the supervision of the PI, Professor Daisuke Kiga, who is an expert in synthetic biology. 
                Since the project started, we have continued to connect with the public. 
                At times, as educators, we have taught high school students what synthetic biology is. (Go to the Education page.) 
                At other times, as an entrepreneur, we carefully researched and brushed up on real-world problems, discussing them with people and experts in the field who were facing real-world problems. (Go to Entrepreneurship page. )
