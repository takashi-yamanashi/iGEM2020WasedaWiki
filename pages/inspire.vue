WEBVTT

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
- Hello everyone! We are team Qdai

00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:33.300
- and we are here to present our project "P.coli".

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.500
- In this project, we are engineering E.coli bacteria to have an increased capacity of phosphorus accumulation.

00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:48.000
- Our university is surrounded by nature and agriculture,
- so we are familiar with environmental issues.

00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:55.000
- As we consisted of members from various majors,
- we wanted to work on something related to everyone

00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:56.400
- and came up with this project. 

00:00:56.405 --> 00:01:00.000
- In fact, phosphorus has serious problems.

00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:05.500
- Without phosphorus, life is not possible.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.500
- Phosphorus is an important element in DNA, RNA and cell membranes.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.000
- It is one of the three main nutrients of plants together with nitrogen and potassium.

00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:21.700
- Phosphorus fertilizer is essential for modern food production.

00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:28.500
- However, when excessed phosphorus enters aquatic environment, 
- it allows algae to glow faster.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.200
- This is called "Eutrophication".

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.500
- Increase in algae eliminates oxygen in the water
- and lead to the death of aquatic lives,

00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:39.500
- resulting in ecological imbalance.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.500
- Some algae species produce toxins harmful to humans,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.000
- and also place a burden on drinking water production.

00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:50.700
- This picture was taken near our university.

00:01:51.005 --> 00:01:55.500
- Algae are not still dense, but some species prefer clean water cannot be survived.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.200
- Another problem of phosphorus is that it is a finite resource.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.500
- Phosphorus rocks are not evenly distributed around the world.

00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:14.000
- In 2015, world's total phosphorus rocks reserves were reported as 223 million tons,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.500
- of which 70 % in Morocco, China and America.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.000
- High quality phosphate rocks with relatively low concentrations of heavy metals and radionuclides are estimated to be exhausted in 125 years.

00:02:29.005 --> 00:02:37.700
- Japan relies on imports for all the phosphorus needs, 
- so securing the sustainable supply is a rising issue.

00:02:38.005 --> 00:02:45.500
- Currently, phosphorus in the wastewater is mainly removed by biological degradation at sewage treatment plants.

00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:48.200
- This is called an aerobic method.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.500
- In this process, wastewater is mixed with activated sludge,

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.000
- and the microorganisms in the sludge take up the phosphorus.

00:02:56.005 --> 00:02:59.500
- But the microbes here are difficult to adjust.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
- This activated sludge is then dewatered to reduce its volume,

00:03:03.005 --> 00:03:12.700
- and the Magnesium Ammonium Phosphate (MAP) method is used for removing phosphorus from the discharged water which contains high concentrations of phosphorus.

00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:18.500
- The phosphorus removed here turns to a fertilizer, but this is very expensive.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.200
- Current technology is limited,

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.500
- and we will be solving the phosphorus problems using synthetic biology.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.500
- The goal of our project is to engineer E.coli bacteria to accumulate more phosphorus and then recycle it.

00:03:35.005 --> 00:03:41.700
- The advantage of our solution is that it enables recovery and recycle of phosphorus at the same time.

00:03:42.005 --> 00:03:49.000
- By removing extra phosphorus in wastewater more efficiently it is contributing to solve environmental problems.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:59.200
- as well as resource problems by regenerating high-quality phosphorus without containing radioactive elements and other harmful substances.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
- Spread of covid-19 has had a huge impact on our project.

00:04:08.505 --> 00:04:13.000
- This year is the first year that our team is participating in iGEM.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.200
- We were assembled in March of 2020,
- and our journey started from finding team PIs and members, 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.500
- but it was difficult to do online.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.500
- Since the lab was closed, we could not complete the engineering cycle of synthetic biology.

00:04:28.005 --> 00:04:34.000
- This season, almost all works were done online but we sometimes faced troubles in communicating. 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.000
- At last we were able to meet each other for the first time in October.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.200
- From next slides, we are talking the details of our project.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
- Next, I’m talking about phosphorus metabolism. Please look at this figure.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:57.200
- Bacteria have a phosphorus metabolic system, but they only can accumulate up to 2 % of its dry mass.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:07.000
-In order to enhance the phosphorus capability of E. coli, we are going to focus on two functional genes ppk and relA. 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.000
- These genes encode enzymes that promote poly phosphate accumulation. 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:21.000
- In our project, the expression levels of both genes are regulated by inducible promoters, pLtetO1 and pLlacO1. 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:31.000
-  And optimal poly phosphate concentration in E. coli is controlled from both the outflow flux and inflow flux of the polyphosphate pool. 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:44.500
- As you can see, we focus on the phosphate transporter as our further experiments.
pstSCAB is the most common channel responsible for inorganic phosphorus transport. 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
- And phnCDE plays an important role of transporting phosphonic acid.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000
- Our wetlab projects were initially planned to be carried out according to this engineering cycle. 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:05.800
- But, because of COVID-19, our experiments at the university were severely restricted.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
- Hence, it caused a major delay in the project.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:20.000
- First, we designed the two plasmid which include relA and ppk respectively. 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:26.000
- Then computer simulation was performed to monitor the intracellular poly phosphate concentration. 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:36.000
- To achieve higher phosphate remediation for practical use, we combined the two genes into a single plasmid. 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:52.000
- After building the plasmid and carrying out transformation, we tackle on the culture of engineered E. coli under batch culture condition to evaluate how it works in lab-scale experiments. 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:07:00.600
- We monitor the phosphate concentration in the medium by using 
Molybdenum blue absorptiometry assay.  

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
- Then we take out the precipitate.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:16.000
- We will regenerate the phosphorus by heating the cell and adding sodium hydroxide and CaCl2. 

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:27.000
- The final product is hydroxyapatite. 
- By meagering the weight of it, the phosphorus regeneration capability is evaluated. 

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:35.000
- In addition, this final compound is used as a fertilizer in the plant cultivation test. 

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:47.800
- When relA and ppk are overexpressed to enhance phosphate capability, it can cause growth rate decline or may lead lethal damage to the cells. 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:55.000
- There are different reasons for this to happen with ppk and relA.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.000
- Since the exchange of phosphorus between phosphate and ATP is reversible, 

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:10.000
- and as you know, ATP is one of the most important active carriers, overexpression of ppk is presumed to cause serious damage.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:18.100
- relA also has a problem, stringent response. 

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:31.000
- When E. coli are exposed to extreme starvation, synthesis of their rRNA is quickly curtailed for adapting the undernourished environment.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:35.000
- This phenomenon is called stringent response. 

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.000
- relA can induce same response. 

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:51.000 
- In previous study carried out by other research group, the relationship between 
PPX activity and ppGpp was unveiled.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000 
- As you can see, ppGpp inhibited the PPX activity.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:08.000
- However, other research group elucidated the sudden decrease of growth rate when overexpressed relA in E. coli.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:17.200
- Therefore, we try adjusting optimal expression levels of these trade-offs genes to achieve maximum poly phosphate accumulation.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
- Our goal is to recover the most amount of phosphorus.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:38.000
- We built a model to determine how much ppk and relA are expressed to recover the most phosphorus. 

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
- We created a differential equation for E. coli populations.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:10:00.000
- Based on a logistic model, we reflected the negative impact on increasing 
- by accumulation of polyphosphate and the expression of relA.

00:10:06.805 --> 00:10:09.805
- The detail of formula to reflect the negative effect is below. 
- f and g formula.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:25.000
- Second, we created a differential equation for Concentration of polyphosphoric acid.
- It is based on Michaelis‐Menten equation.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:35.600
-The first term on the right hand of the equation reflect the reaction of Phosphoric acid to polyphosphoric acid. 

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
- PPK is represented with a variable called r1

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:51.800
- The second one reflects the reaction of polyphosphoric acid to phosphoric acid and competitive inhibition by relA.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000
- relA is represented with a variable called z.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:03.700
- We assume phosphoric acid concentration is constant.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
- F is the product of N and X 

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:23.000
- N is E. coli ‘s population and X is concentration of polyphosphoric acids.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000
- The formula of F represents the quantity of all recovered polyphosphoric acids.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.700
- F is plotted on two axes, r1 and z.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:44.000
- From the graph we can say to collect more phosphorus, to express more relA.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000
- We also consider the time of starting expression of relA.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:12.000
- As a result, we found that starting to induce relA expression when E. coli moved into the stationary phase was the best way to recover the most amount of phosphorus.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.000
- This time, we interviewed people who are involved in eutrophication in Japan and improved the plan.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:30.000  
- The organizations we visited are as follows. 

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:39.000 
- The fields are diverse, including sewage treatment plants, administration, research institutes, and so on.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:51.000
- The following are the main contents that we were influenced by listening to the organizations.

00:12:53.005 --> 00:13:02.000
- First, we originally thought that the main source of phosphorus released into the environment was fertilization from farmland 

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:10.000
- because we knew that almost all imported phosphorus ore are used for fertilizer. 

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:18.000
- However, we were told that much fertilizer accumulate in the soil as a hardly soluble form 

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:29.000            
- and when phosphorus is discharged into the environment and flows into rivers, it will be diluted by a large amount of water. 

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:36.500
- We also learned that a good place to install our device is where phosphorus is concentrated.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:46.080
- Others suggested that agricultural wastewater do not contain constant phosphorus throughout the year.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:59.500
- Treatment using microorganisms called the activated sludge method has already been carried out in such places so it is easy to introduce our E. coli.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:07.600
- Phosphorus rich areas such as domestic and industrial wastewater are ideal for installing our devices. 

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:21.070
- Therefore, although we were considering a phosphorus recovery method using the device we created, we have come to consider introducing into the existing technology.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:34.000
- We were also able to talk to other organizations and companies that are working on the recovery of phosphorus. 

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:43.010
- There, they taught me the difficulty of recovering phosphorus and then making a profit.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:54.000
- While the MAP method can recover phosphorus, it is expensive because it is difficult to maintain the equipment. 

00:14:54.050 --> 00:15:00.050 
- Therefore, even if phosphorus is reused, the expense will increase rather than the profit.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:13.050
- We learned that even if they tried to develop an alternative technology, the price would not be lower than the price of phosphorus made from existing technology.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.010
- We should focus on not profit but cut cost of removal phosphorus.  

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:26.010
- We should recycle into white phosphorus because it is relatively expensive.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:42.000
- And when we talked to an organization exploring the environmental situation, we learned that Japan is also facing the problem of oligotrophication, which is the opposite of eutrophication.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:52.000
- They said that the improvement in sewage conditions in Japan has reduced the amount of phosphorus released into environment, 

00:15:52.800 --> 00:16:00.000     
- and the quality of marine products cultivated in the sea has deteriorated.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:11.000
- Due to this effect, some groups have appealed to sewers to discharge a certain amount of phosphorus in order to make good seaweed.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:19.000
- We should aim the overseas where the sewer system has not been constructed yet.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
- Then, how will our E. coli be used?

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:32.000
- First, it can be incorporated into existing technologies.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:39.000
- Currently, the bureau of sewerage uses the activated sludge process to remove dirt from sewage.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:47.000
- In activated sludge, there are a large number of microorganisms, and it reduces the amount of organic matter in sewage.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:53.000
- Phosphorus is also taken up by microorganisms and removed from sewage.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:17:02.000
- Therefore, we think that adding the E. coli we develop to activated sludge, we can remove phosphorus in domestic wastewater more efficiently.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:11.000
- However, the method of isolating and recovering only phosphorus from sewage remains the same so it is also costly.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:20.000
- It will be possible to remove phosphorus more efficiently and improve the environment, but it will still be difficult to make a profit.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000
- Next, we can make a device that recovers only phosphorus by using the E. coli we develop.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:37.000
- In areas where sewerage is in place, it may be more efficient to treat the sewage collectively at the bureau of sewerage,

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:44.000
- but the areas where sewage is not yet in place, such as developing company where eutrophication is serious 

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:50.000
may need a phosphorus removal system that can be done individually on a small scale.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:18:01.000
- We think that using our E. coli, phosphorus can be recovered in a single tank without creating the aerobic tank and anaerobic tank

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:07.000
- which is required for the activated sludge process so a compact device can be made.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:18.000
- We understand the risks of working in a lab and handling genetically modified organisms. 

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:26.010
- Our team took the safety side of our project seriously and aim to ensure no personal and environmental harm occurs.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:36.000
- The bacteria we will be working with are non-pathogenic and the genes expressed are not known to cause any harm to humans. 

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:48.000
- We attended safety trainings and also as one of the Human Practice activities, we spoke to a person from administration to ensure the safe design of our project.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
- We’d like to thank all the people we’ve interacted in the project

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
- and last but not least our sponsors.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
- Thank you for listening.
