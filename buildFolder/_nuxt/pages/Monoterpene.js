In order to take advantage of an engineering principle of synthetic biology we provided two biobrick parts (BBa_K3580101, BBa_K3580102) for the source for the latter extract.  BBa_K3580101 has GPP synthase (GPPS) and limonene synthase.  Although GPP synthase is shared with BBa_K3580101, BBa_K3580102 has sabinene synthase, which has one point mutation in limonenesynthase (Srividya Narayanan et al 2015) and a new coding sequence for Parts registry of iGEM (See here for more details on this experiments).                             \n                          ")])])],1),e._v(" "),n("v-row",{staticClass:"row_max-box",attrs:{cols:"12",sm:"12",xs:"12",md:"12",lg:"7",xl:"7"}},[n("v-col",[n("h3",[e._v("Materials and Methods")]),e._v(" "),n("p",[e._v("   \n                              Cell growth and extract preparation                         \n                          ")]),e._v(" "),n("p",{staticClass:"p_indent"},[e._v("  \n                              Transformed DH5-α strains were grown in 2xYT medium containing 25 ng/µl chloramphenicol and 1% glucose concentration.

Although elaborative reconstituted system by mixing of purified enzymes has been reported (Srividya Narayanan et al 2015), (Korman Tyler P et al 2017).  Extract-base system with not only simple but engineering principle must provide much contribution to iGEM and DIY biology which as large number of players. Furthermore, extract systems do not require expensive coenzymes (Dudly et al 2019). As well as limonene detection in Fig 3-3-3-2, we firstly confirmed sabinene retention time and SIM signal at the m/z values (77, 91, and 93).  From our cell-free production, we then detected sabinene SIM signal and chromatogram peak which cannot find from the negative control.  Also, from the system containing sabinene synthase and GPP synthase, a peak with the same retention time as the standard limonene product and ions with m/z values characteristic in limonene at that retention time were detected.  This was consistent with the fact that the paper that referred to the sabinene synthase used in this experiment also reported the synthesis of limonene as a by-product (Srividya Narayanan. et al 2015).                            \n                          ")])])],1),e._v(" "),n("v-row",{staticClass:"row_max-box",attrs:{cols:"12",sm:"12",xs:"12",md:"12",lg:"7",xl:"7"}},[n("figure",{staticClass:"fig_full_width"},[n("img",{staticClass:"image_max",attrs:{src:"https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/d/dd/T--Waseda--monoterpene_3-3-3-4_Unknown_by-product_of_cell-free_sabinene_synthesis.png",alt:"Fig. 3-3-3-4 Unknown by-product of cell-free sabinene synthesis"}}),e._v(" "),n("figcaption",{staticClass:"fig_title"},[e._v("Fig. 3-3-3-4 Unknown by-product of cell-free sabinene synthesis")])])]),e._v(" "),n("v-row",{staticClass:"row_max-box",attrs:{cols:"12",sm:"12",xs:"12",md:"12",lg:"7",xl:"7"}},[n("v-col",[n("p",{staticClass:"p_indent"},[e._v("    \n                              On the other hand, in the sabinene synthesis system using the extract, a large peak of an unknown substance with a mass spectrum similar to that of sabinene but with a different retention time was detected.

Taking advantage of the modularity of the combination of extracts, we confirmed whether the yield of monoterpenes could be changed by changing the mixing ratio of the extract containing the enzyme of the mevalonate pathway and the extract containing GPP synthase and monoterpene synthase.  As a result, changes in the yield of monoterpenes due to the mixing ratio of the extracts were observed (Figure. 3-3-3-5).  The best yield of limonene per reaction solution with limonene synthase contained system was 0.73 µM, and the best yield of sabinene per reaction solution with sabinene synthase contained system was 4.60 µM.  From the relationship between the mixing ratio of the extracts and the yield of sabinene, the optimum mixing ratio of the extract containing the mevalonate pathway enzyme and the extract containing GPP synthase + sabinene synthase considered to exist between 5: 5 and 2: 8.  It was also considered that the yields of the limonene synthesis system were lower than the yields of the sabinene synthesis system because the amount of GPP synthase and limonene synthase expression were small because the culture time after induction of expression was short.  Therefore, increasing the mixing ratio of the extract containing GPP synthase and limonene synthase, or increasing the culture time after expression induction during the preparation of the extract, is expected to increase the yield of limonene.                           \n                          ")])])],1),e._v(" "),n("v-row",{staticClass:"row_max-box",attrs:{cols:"12",sm:"12",xs:"12",md:"12",lg:"7",xl:"7"}},[n("v-col",[n("h3",[e._v("Reference")]),e._v(" "),n("p",[e._v("\n                            (1) Alonso-Gutierrez, J. et al.
